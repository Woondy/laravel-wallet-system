## Concurrency Handling

In this wallet system project, we use pessimistic locking to ensure the safety of wallet operations during concurrent transactions. By locking the relevant records within a database transaction, we can prevent multiple concurrent operations from modifying the same wallet balance, thereby ensuring data consistency and integrity. 

## Implementation Details
### Use Cases for Pessimistic Locking
    - Deposit Operations: Ensure that only one deposit operation can modify the balance of a wallet at the same time.
    - Withdrawal Operations: Ensure that only one withdrawal operation can modify the balance of a wallet at the same time.
    - Rebate Calculation: Lock relevant records during the calculation and issuance of rebates to ensure the correctness of the rebate amount.

### Code Example
Here is an example of how to use the lockForUpdate() method and database transactions (DB::transaction()) in Laravel to implement pessimistic locking and ensure data integrity:

    public function deposit(Wallet $wallet, $amount)
    {
        // Begin a database transaction to ensure atomicity of operations
        DB::transaction(function () use ($wallet, $amount) {
            // Lock the specified wallet record to prevent concurrent modifications
            $wallet->lockForUpdate();

            ...
        });
    }

## Conclusion

By using pessimistic locking and database transactions, we can ensure safe operations on wallet balances in a concurrent environment, avoiding data inconsistencies and race conditions. Pessimistic locking locks the relevant records within the database transaction until the transaction is complete, ensuring the atomicity and integrity of the operations. Database transactions ensure the atomicity of a series of operations. if any operation fails, the entire transaction will roll back, ensuring the database remains in a consistent state. This strategy is especially important for financial systems that require high consistency and data accuracy.
